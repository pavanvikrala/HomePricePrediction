# Predicting Home Prices in USA based on certain factors.

The goal of the project was to find publicly available data related to supply and demand factors that influence US home prices nationally. 
This step involved researching and identifying relevant data sources like Months of supply, Unemployment, Mortgage rate, personal savings etc. These were finally taken as feature variables in our ML model.
The data source "S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index" was used as target variable.
Data preparation is a critical step in building a data science model. During this stage, the collected data underwent :
>>  Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inaccuracies.
>>  Data Formatting: Ensuring data is in the right format and converting variables (if needed).
>>  Feature Selection: Identifying which factors are most relevant for the analysis.
Chose Linear regression Model.....fed the data and eventually trained the model.
The final step is Model Evaluation. This involves assessing how well the model predicts home prices based on supply and demand factors.
Used different metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy.
Data visualization is also done using "Residual Plots" to check the assumptions and performance of the model.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebooks provided in this repository to gain insights into the project.
